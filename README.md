## Why another open-source media server?

The philosophy behind Meteorae is a bit different from other existing open source media servers like [Jellyfin](), [Olaris]() or [Dim]().

Meteorae is built from the ground up to support every media type and allow for cross-linking metadata. For example, you might want to find more work by your favorite costume designer. Meteorae can help you figure out that they also worked on a music video by your favorite artist, or wrote a book about costume design that you might want to read.

In short, Meteorae helps you explore your content through an extensive relationship graph, making it easier to find movies, series, books or music you want to experience.

But Meteorae is also built with a specific idea of how your media server should work on a technical level. From handling very large playlists, to deeply analyzing your files or shuffling your music in the best way possible, Meteorae makes opinionated choices as to how things _should_ work.
